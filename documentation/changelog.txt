To do list:

  - add a window to ask the user to save its query if the query is modified and unsaved when he wants to leave the software.
  - add text to all infobuttons.
  - add the fact that 'step' checkboxes can be disabled based on 'time' checkboxes.
  - find a new way to prepare the database to store the fact that parameters exist in 'fc' and/or 'an' type.
  - change logic between tabs to take into account the fact just above.
  - correct the display of the download speed in the download window if speed is above 1MB.
  - in the case of the update of the update system, find a way to say to the user that he has to donwload and install the update manually.


May 18 2018, Release version 0.8.0
==================================
Version for testing purposes.

  ADDED:
    - a function to translate user inputs into a new query for ECMWF API has been introduced. The function is still in beta state and not perfect. If the query is not well prepared, the http response will contain an error displayed in the Download window.
  
  FIXED:
    - if a new option is not present in the 'ecmwf_downloader.ini', it is not created at startup. It has been fixed.


May 17 2018, Release version 0.7.1
==================================
Version for testing purposes. A version dedicated to Linux has been built.
  
  ADDED:
    - a specific way to manage update and update download based on OS (linux, windows) has been introduced. The automatic update is available on windows, but on linux the user has to unzip the package and install it himself.
  
  
May 16 2018, Release version 0.7
================================
Version for testing purposes. A first version of a function to connect to the ECMWF API has been added and tested with a simple query. As the function to translate user inputs into a query is not ready yet, it has been disabled for now (but it is present in the code).

  ADDED:
    - a custom thread, based on requests, has been integrated to donwload data from ECMWF servers with the official web API.
    - a function to save the inputs of the user for a query as an xml file.
    - a function to open an xml file containing the inputs of the user for a query.
    - a first version of a function to connect to the ECMWF API has been added.

  FIXED:
    - no icon for the download window.
    - fixed the automatic naming of the checkboxes involved in the time period section.
  
  MODIFIED:
    - improved logic between tabs.
    - improved use of stylesheet for the checking function.
